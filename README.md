A Simple Sample App which demonstrates - CURD operation using Hibernate Framework and PostgreSQL DB(JAVA) in Eclipse

This application is developed in Eclipse using Java Dynamic Web Application

1)JSP
2)Hibernate
3)PostgreSQL
4)Glassfish ( i tested in glassfish only)

Check the hibernate.cfg.xml for Database Connection details. 
(Change db dilact and hibernate properties respectively according to your need)
